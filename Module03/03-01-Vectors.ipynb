    "# Vectors\n",
    "Vectors, and vector spaces, are fundamental to *linear algebra*, and they're used in many machine learning models. Vectors describe spatial lines and planes, enabling you to perform calculations that explore relationships in multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Vector\n",
    "At its simplest, a vector is a numeric element that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. The magnitude represents a distance (for example, \"2 miles\") and the direction indicates which way the vector is headed (for example, \"East\"). Vectors are defined by an n-dimensional coordinate that describe a point in space that can be connected by a line from an arbitrary origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "That all seems a bit complicated, so let's start with a simple, two-dimensional example. In this case, we'll have a vector that is defined by a point in a two-dimensional plane: A two dimensional coordinate consists of an *x* and a *y* value, and in this case we'll use **2** for *x* and **1** for *y*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vector can be written as **v**=(2,1), but more formally we would use the following notation, in which the dimensional coordinate values for the vector are shown as a matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly does that mean? Well, the coordinate is two-dimensional, and describes the movements required to get to the end point (of *head*) of the vector - in this case, we need to move 2 units in the *x* dimension, and 1 unit in the *y* dimension. Note that we don't specify a starting point for the vector - we're simply describing a destination coordinate that encapsulate the magnitide and direction of the vector. Think about it as the directions you need to follow to get to *there* from *here*, without specifying where *here* actually is!\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help to visualize the vector, and with a two-dimensional vector, that's pretty straightforward. We just define a two-dimensional plane, choose a starting point, and plot the coordinate described by the vector relative to the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in the following cell to visualize the vector **v** (which remember is described by the coordinate (2,1))."

    " 3. Vector [-2,-4] has negative x and y. The line for the vector travels through 0,0 from quadrant 1 to quadrant 3. Tan<sup>-1</sup> of -4/-2 is around 63.4 degrees, which is the angle between the x axis and the line, but again in the opposite direction, from quadrant 3 to quadrant 1; we need to go a further 180 degrees to reflect the correct direction.\n",
    " 4. Vector [2,-4] has positive x and negative y. It travels through 0,0 from quadrant 2 to quadrant 4. Tan<sup>-1</sup> of -4/2 is around -64.4 degrees, which is the *negative* angle from the x axis to the vector line. Technically it's correct, the line is travelleing down and to the right at an angle of -63.4 degrees; but we want to express the *positive* (counter-clockwise) angle, so we add 360.\n",

    "In the previous Python code, we used the *math.**atan*** function to calculate the inverse tangent from a numeric tangent. The *numpy* library includes a similar ***arctan*** function. When working with numpy arrays, you can also use the *numpy.**arctan2*** function to return the inverse tangent of an array-based vector in *radians*, and you can use the *numpy.**degrees*** function to convert this to degrees. The ***arctan2*** function automatically makes the necessary adjustment for negative *x* and *y* values."

    "Well, we added the dimensions of **s** to the dimensions of **v** to describe a new vector **z**. Let's break that down:\n",
    "- The dimensions of **v** are (2,1), so from our starting point we move 2 units in the *x* dimension (across to the right) and 1 unit in the *y* dimension (up). In the plot, if you start at the (0,0) position, this is shown as the red arrow.\n",
    "- Then we're adding **s**, which has dimension values (-3, 2), so we move -3 units in the *x* dimension (across to the left, because it's a negative number) and then 2 units in the *y* dimension (up). On the plot, if you start at the head of the red arrow and make these moves, you'll end up at the head of the green arrow, which represents **z**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true if you perform the addition operation the other way around and add **v** to **s**, the steps to create **s** are described by the blue arrow, and if you use that as the starting point for **v**, you'll end up at the head of the green arrow, which represents **z**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on the plot that if you simply moved the tail of the blue arrow so that it started at the head of red arrow, its head would end up in the same place as the head of the green arrow; and the same would be true if you moved tail of the red arrow to the head of the blue arrow."
